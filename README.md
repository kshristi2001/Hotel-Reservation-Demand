# Hotel Reservation Demand Analysis

This project aims to analyze hotel reservation data and develop a machine learning model to predict hotel booking cancellations. The analysis is divided into two main parts: preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling.


## Introduction

Hotel Reservation Demand Analysis is a project aimed at analyzing hotel booking data to understand booking patterns and develop a machine learning model to predict hotel booking cancellations. The project involves preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clean and explore the dataset, followed by modeling to train and evaluate machine learning models.

The dataset used in this project contains information about hotel bookings, including various features such as booking dates, customer demographics, reservation details, and booking status. By analyzing this data, we aim to gain insights into factors affecting booking cancellations and build a predictive model to anticipate cancellations.


## DataSet
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. 
By analyzing this data, we aim to identify factors influencing booking decisions and develop predictive models to anticipate booking cancellations.

## Preprocessing

Loaded the dataset from the 'hotel_bookings.csv' file.
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and removing irrelevant columns.
Processed categorical variables using encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding.
Ensured consistency and uniformity in data format by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from string values.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted basic data exploration to gain insights into the dataset.
Examined the distribution and characteristics of key features using summary statistics.
Investigated data integrity by identifying and addressing missing or erroneous values.
Visualized data patterns and relationships through various plots and charts.
Explored temporal trends and patterns in reservation status and other relevant variables.
##  Modeling

Load preprocessed data.
Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).
Initialize and train a Random Forest classifier and an XGBoost classifier.
Combine predictions from both models using a simple voting mechanism.
Evaluate the accuracy of ensemble predictions.
Compute the confusion matrix and generate a classification report for the ensemble predictions.
